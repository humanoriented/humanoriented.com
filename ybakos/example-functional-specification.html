<h2>Example Functional Specification</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The last time I was in Las Vegas I paused to wonder at how much money gets lost there by all us visitors. The hippie in me wondered what could be possible if all that money were directed toward a more serious cause than fun and gambling.</p>

<p>My problem is that I don't like to gamble. And I have yet to understand why lots of businesses and project teams love to gamble -- every time they try to take on a mid-to-large project without the benefit of a functional specification. <em>C'mon no whammies!</em></p>

<p>How do you communicate that you want the button 32 pixels from the bottom and left of the control pane and what the user should experience when he clicks on it, to five or more people, without repeating yourself? How can you define a standard that the application must meet in order to be considered complete? Have you <em>really</em> thought out each and every portion of the application and its potential pitfalls by sketching it out?</p>

<p>A functional specification <em>is not</em> a rigid thing corporations sign off on. It's <em>not</em> so long that it needs a binder. <strong>A functional specification is a brief design document that <em>communicates</em> what the application is, how it works for the user and what it should roughly look like on the screen.</strong> It should be terse without sacrificing completeness and preferably entertaining (or at least not too mind-numbing).</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Here's an example functional specification. I'm showing you a real one, that ended up making someone lots of money (no whammies). To preserve confidentiality, I'm rendering it small and as a graphic.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ybakos/func-spec09.jpg" title=""></p>
<p><img src="/img/ybakos/func-spec10.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>So the next time a colleague asks what you're working on or your family members ask &quot;what is it you really do for a living?&quot you can show them.</p>

<p>If you want a closer look, my specs basically resemble <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/RandomStuff/copilot_spec.pdf" title="Project Aardvark Spec">Joel Spolsky's approach</a>.</p>
