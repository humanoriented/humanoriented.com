<p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p>
<p>My name is Yong Joseph Bakos; it is a mix of both Hungarian and Korean origin. I am a second-generation software developer from a family line of architects and musicians.</p>
<p>I first used a computer, the DEC VAX, at age five while accompanying my father among the halls of machines at Systems Research Laboratories. Imagine this kid, sitting at a PDP-11 green-screen terminal, looking up at a towering wall of blinking lights. Surreal.</p>
<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Ohio as a normal, sports-playing, girl-chasing kid. I learned procedural programming in BASIC and C at a young age. My professional education began early, by sitting in on my father's classes at Edison State College and also enrolling in programming classes at Wright State University. I was about 14 at the time.</p>
<p>Since that young age my professional software development experience has encompassed startups, enterprise work, agency-style development and consulting. I have successfully delivered successful products on all major development platforms such as Java, .NET, PHP and more contemporary platforms like Rails and Flash. I am fluent with most popular database systems, development processes, frameworks, tools and operating systems; and software design approaches like AJAX. My recent professional experience is listed in the attached resume. Code samples, design documents and professional references follow.</p>
<p>All buzzwords and programming languages aside, my best professional traits are that <em>I successfully deliver software</em> and that <em>my most fluent 'technical' language is English.&nbsp;</em> In my experience, the craft of software development is less about technology and more about people and communication.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. If my qualifications meet your requirements, let's talk about what I can do for you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
